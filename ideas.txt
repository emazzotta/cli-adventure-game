Things to think about:
Should we add the actions to the various game elements classes or create one class which has the whole game logic?


- Collect/Take Shovel -> Assume all if nothing passed as well as Collect without params = COLLECT ALL ALL
- Implement save game and load game as commands
- Implement queue fetcher
- Meaningful errormessage if file or folder does not exist when saving or loading
- Guns with Damage points
- Boss with health
- There's a monster, run away or fight

Tasks:
- Show output in GUI
- Implement Rooms
- Implement Weapons
- Implement Potions
- Implement Fight-logic

Navigation:
- Show current position (which room are you in and path taken)
- Change room
- Show available doors

In-Room actions:
- See room inventory
- Collect items

Player related actions:
- Use Potion
- Show inventory
- Equip item

Combat:
- Flee
- Do Damage / take damage
- Die / drop loot (monster)

UserStateclass:

- Player
- Room
- Inventory

Has all methods to change itself (e.g. open door etc.


Class combat (handles combat related actions)
